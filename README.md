# Text-Editor

This Text-Editor is made by using javaSwing Library which provides us with multiple predefined classes by which we can make different pre-build functions.

Text-editor is a app which we use more oftenly to write and read text files and use some features like cut copy paste in this project i have implemented these functions which a user can use and handle very easily.




## javaSwing Library

Java Swing is a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) components for building desktop applications in Java. It provides a rich set of tools and components that allow developers to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.Here are some key functionalities of the Java 

Swing library:

* Components: Swing provides a comprehensive set of GUI components such as buttons, text fields, labels, panels, dialogs, and more. These components are used to create the various elements of a user interface.

* Lightweight Architecture: Swing is built on top of the Java Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) and is known for its lightweight nature. It doesn't rely on the native platform's GUI components, making Swing applications platform-independent.

* Customization: Developers can extensively customize the appearance and behavior of Swing components. This includes setting colors, fonts, and other visual properties, as well as handling events to define how components respond to user interactions.

* Layout Managers: Swing provides layout managers that help arrange components within a container in a consistent and flexible manner. Layout managers automatically adjust the position and size of components based on the size of the container.

* Event Handling: Swing supports event-driven programming. Developers can define event listeners to handle user actions such as button clicks, mouse events, and key presses. This allows for creating responsive and interactive applications.

* Double Buffering: Swing uses double buffering to reduce flickering in graphical updates. This technique involves drawing graphics off-screen before displaying them on the screen, providing a smoother visual experience.

* Concurrency Support: Swing components are not thread-safe by default, but Swing provides utilities for handling concurrency in GUI applications, such as the SwingWorker class for background tasks.

* Internationalization (I18N): Swing supports internationalization and localization, allowing developers to create applications that can be easily adapted to different languages and regions.

* Drag-and-Drop: Swing includes built-in support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier for users to interact with data in a graphical interface.

* Accessibility: Swing provides features to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities, such as support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

* Java Swing has been widely used for developing desktop applications, although in recent years, JavaFX has gained popularity as an alternative framework for building rich and modern user interfaces in Java.



## javaSwing components used in Text-Editor

* JFrame: JFrame is a class in the Java Swing library that represents a top-level container for creating and managing a windowed GUI application. It provides the outer frame or window that holds and organizes other Swing components.

* JMenuBar: JMenuBar is a Swing component in Java that represents a menu bar, typically used in graphical user interfaces to organize and present a set of menus in a GUI application. A JMenuBar is added to a JFrame or another top-level container and contains instances of JMenu, which, in turn, can contain items like JMenuItem, JRadioButtonMenuItem, JCheckBoxMenuItem, and more.

* JMenu: JMenu is a Swing component in Java that represents a menu, which is a drop-down or popup list of items that can trigger various actions or display sub-menus. JMenu is often used as part of a JMenuBar, but it can also be used as a standalone component.

* JMenuItem: JMenuItem is a Swing component in Java that represents an individual item within a menu. It is typically used in conjunction with JMenu to create a list of clickable options in a graphical user interface. JMenuItem can trigger actions when selected by the user, and it comes in various forms, such as standard items (JMenuItem).

* JTextArea: JTextArea is a Swing component in Java that provides a multi-line area for displaying and editing text. It allows users to input, view, and manipulate text in a more extensive and flexible manner than a single-line text field. JTextArea is commonly used in GUI applications for tasks such as text editing, displaying log information, or providing a space for user input that may involve multiple lines.
## ActionListener interface

ActionListener is an interface in Java used for handling action events, which are generated by components such as buttons, menu items, and other interactive elements in a graphical user interface (GUI). When the user interacts with a component that generates action events, the registered ActionListener is notified, and the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method is called. This method contains the code that responds to the user's action.

Here are key points about the ActionListener interface:

1. Interface Definition: The ActionListener interface is part of the java.awt.event package in Java. It defines a single method:
-> void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e);

This method is called when an action event occurs.

2. Event Source: Components that generate action events must implement the ActionListener interface or have a mechanism to register objects that implement this interface.

3. Registration: To handle action events, you need to register an object (often a class that implements ActionListener) with the component that generates the events. This is typically done using the addActionListener(ActionListener listener) method provided by the component.

4. ActionEvent: The ActionEvent class encapsulates information about the event, such as the source of the event and any command string associated with the action. The getSource() method of ActionEvent returns the object that fired the event.
